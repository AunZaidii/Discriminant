# Discriminant Calculator

Welcome to the Discriminant Calculator repository!

## Overview

This project aims to provide a tool for calculating the discriminant of a quadratic equation. The discriminant is a value derived from the coefficients of a quadratic equation and plays a crucial role in determining the nature of its roots.

## Usage

To use this tool, simply follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Execute the program according to the instructions provided in the documentation or README file.
4. Input the coefficients of the quadratic equation when prompted.
5. The program will output the calculated discriminant value.

## Example

For instance, consider the quadratic equation: ax^2 + bx + c = 0. The discriminant, denoted as D, is calculated using the formula: D = b^2 - 4ac. Depending on the value of D, we can determine the nature of the roots:

- If D > 0, the equation has two distinct real roots.
- If D = 0, the equation has repeated real roots.
- If D < 0, the equation has complex roots.
